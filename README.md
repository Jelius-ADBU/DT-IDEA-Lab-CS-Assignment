# Assignment: Library Book Management

## Problem: 
1. Students have to physically go to the library to see if a book is available or not.
2. Even if a book is available it may be reserved by someone else.

## Solutions: 
1. Create an empathy map of the problems.
2. Create a web/mobile app design prototypein Figma that would let students search a book and see if it is available in the library instead of physically going to the library.
3. If a student is interested in a book then send notification if the book was reserved before and comes back.

## Empathy map

Student: Jane Doe

| <span>Jane says that it is inconvenient to go to the library to search for a book.</span> </br></br> <span>She prefers an online platform to do so.<span> | She thinks that it is a waste of time to go to the library to search for a book only to realize that it is already reserved by someone else. |
| --- | --- |
| <b>She usually goes to the library to search for a book</b> </br> </br> <b>Most of the time the book is either unavailable or reserved by someone else.</b> | <b> She feels this can be optimzed with an online web app which can let her know about availability before she even goes to the library</b> </br> </br> <b>This could even reduce noise and people walking around in the library, helping other to concentrate better.</b> |
