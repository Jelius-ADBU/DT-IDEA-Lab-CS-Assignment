# Assignment: Library Book Management

## Problem: 
1. Students have to physically go to the library to see if a book is available or not.
2. Even if a book is available it may be reserved by someone else.

## Solutions: 
1. Create an empathy map of the problems.
2. Create a web/mobile app that would let students search a book and see if it is available in the library instead of physically going to the library.
3. If a student is interested in a book then send notification if the book was reserved before and comes back.
